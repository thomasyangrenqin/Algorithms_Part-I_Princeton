This repository kept track of all the programming assignments of the course, **"Algorithms Part I, Princeton University"**, which I took from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) .

### About the course
---
This course has been one of the most famous Computer Science course at Princeton, and covers the essential information about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of java implementations. The part I covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. 

All the programming assignments are extremely challenging and helpful for understanding all the basic algorithms and concepts talking in the course. There are totally five programming assignments, which were correspondingly divided into five weeks.

### Notice
---
As you can at the beginning of each java file. There is a line like:
```
import import edu.princeton.cs.algs4*
```
As one of the resources in this course, I was allowed to use this particular library to help better test and output any results I might produce. Therefore, to functionally well run all my assignments code, you also need to download and import this library from Princeton. You can find it [here](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4).
